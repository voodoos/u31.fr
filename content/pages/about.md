## Who ?
My name is Ulysse Gérard and I am a (soon former) PhD student in computer
science. My main research topics involve logic, proof-search, functional
programming and language design.

## Why is this blog Naked ? And empty ?
*The Naked Lunch* is a science-fiction surrealist novel written by William S.
Burroughs. It was adapted by David Cronenberg in 1991.

Not only a "code blog", I would like to share my perception of cinema via a
series of short movie critics and other non-computer-related works such as paper
folding.

It is new, and it is empty.
