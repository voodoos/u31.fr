## Who ?
I am a (soon former) PhD student in computer science. My main research topics
involve logic, proof-search, and functional programming language design. I am
also a documentation addict and take an unnatural pleasure in learning new
languages, technologies and tools. This website itself is written in
OCaml/ReasonML, compiled to ReactJS and statically built with GatsbyJS...

## Why is this blog Naked ?
I would like this website to be more than a simple "code blog" with programming tips and
so on. It aims to be a personal place where I will also share non-computer
related projects and thoughts about books and movies I enjoy.

*The Naked Lunch* is both of these: a science-fiction novel written by William
S. Burroughs, and a movie by David Cronenberg inspired by the book.

Sorry, you will not find nudes on this blog, apart from some obscene origamis...
