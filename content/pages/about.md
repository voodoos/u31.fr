## Who ?
I am a (soon former) PhD student in computer
science. My main research topics involve logic, proof-search, functional
programming and language design. bla bla

## Why is this blog Naked ?
*The Naked Lunch* is a science-fiction surrealist novel written by William S.
Burroughs. It was adapted by David Cronenberg in 1991.

This is not only a "code blog", I would like it to be a personal place where I
share programming tips along with others projects and discoveries. I will also
try to transmit my perception of cinema via a series of short movie critics.

Also, it is naked because it is empty, hopefully it won't last!
